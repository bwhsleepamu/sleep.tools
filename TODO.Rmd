This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

## COMPARISONS
1. Show distribution of consecutive bouts before transformation vs. after transformation
2. In the distribution graphs, color-code the type of epoch


# LIST
## Cycle calculation
1. For each subject, sleep period (sp)
  - take start of NREM (full)
  - cycle goes until the start of next NREM
  - if our NREM definitions are right, then period outline is trivial
  - Do same for REM
  
### Dealing with WaKe
- classic method: merge wake into either rem or nrem
- chanbepoint method: wake periods are existant
- improved method: wake periods are existant

1. Minimum length for "significant" wake period is 5 min
2. Minimum length for "significant" 
  
# Improved Method (iterative)
1. iteratively take the smallest consecutive bout (low to high)
2. Merge into the largest neighbor
3.
